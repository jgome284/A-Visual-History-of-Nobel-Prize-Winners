<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/jgome284/A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners)

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. In [this notebook](notebook.ipynb), a comprehensive analysis of Nobel Prize winner history is complete by exploring categories including gender, age, and country.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To recreate this project locally, you can clone this repository via HTTPS as follows.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jgome284/A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners.git 
```
### Environment
Virtual environments are a great way to keep your system-wide Python installation clean and organized. Each virtual environment is isolated from the others, so changes you make to the packages in one virtual environment will not affect the packages in another virtual environment. This can help to prevent conflicts between packages that are used by different projects.

**Create**

 You can create a virtual environment named my_env to manage this projects dependencies, for example. To do so, run the following command:
```sh
python3 -m venv my_env
```

**Activate**

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:
```sh
source my_env/bin/activate
```

**Deactivate**

To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following command:
```sh
deactivate
```

### Dependencies
Python version 3.9.6 was used to run this analysis. To install additional dependencies, run the following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Best practice is to install these dependencies into an activated virtual environment. ```pip``` should be smart enough to handle dependencies between all packages required during installation.
